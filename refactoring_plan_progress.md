# Refactoring Progress Report

## Overview

This document outlines the progress made on the refactoring plan for the rect_graph_connector project, focusing on improving the codebase according to SOLID principles and high cohesion/low coupling design.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Model Layer Implementation (Completed)
- ✅ ViewStateModel: Implemented with zoom, pan_offset, grid state management
- ✅ SelectionModel: Implemented with selection state management
- ✅ HoverStateModel: Implemented with hover state management

### Phase 2: Rendering System Improvement (Partially Completed)
- ✅ BaseRenderer: Improved with ViewStateModel integration
- ✅ Style system: Implemented base style classes
  - ✅ BaseStyle
  - ✅ NodeStyle, NodeBorderStyle, NodeColorStyle
  - ✅ GroupStyle
  - ✅ EdgeStyle
- ✅ Renderer components:
  - ✅ NodeRenderer
  - ✅ GroupRenderer
  - ✅ EdgeRenderer
  - ✅ CompositeRenderer
  - ✅ GridRenderer
  - ✅ BorderRenderer
  - ✅ SelectionRenderer
  - ✅ KnifeRenderer
  - ✅ BridgeRenderer

### Phase 3: Event Handling Separation (In Progress)
- ✅ InputHandler: Implemented centralized input handling
- ✅ ModeController: Implemented base controller for mode-specific logic
- ✅ Mode-specific controllers:
  - ✅ NormalModeController: Implemented for normal mode interactions
  - ✅ EditModeController: Implemented for edit mode interactions

## Current Status

The refactoring is progressing well, with the model layer complete and the rendering system mostly implemented. The event handling system has been designed and implemented, but needs to be integrated with the CanvasView class.

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Event Handling Separation (Remaining Work)
- ⬜ Integrate InputHandler with CanvasView
- ⬜ Update CanvasView to delegate all input handling to InputHandler
- ⬜ Test the new input handling system

### Phase 4: CanvasView Refactoring
- ⬜ Complete migration of state management to models
- ⬜ Remove remaining direct state manipulation in CanvasView
- ⬜ Simplify CanvasView to focus on rendering and delegating input

## Implementation Details

### InputHandler

The InputHandler centralizes all input processing and delegates to appropriate mode controllers based on the current mode. It provides a clean separation between input handling and rendering logic.

```python
class InputHandler:
    def __init__(self, view_state, selection_model, hover_state, graph):
        # Initialize models and controllers
        
    def handle_mouse_press(self, event, widget_point):
        # Convert to graph coordinates and delegate to mode controller
        
    def handle_mouse_move(self, event, widget_point):
        # Handle panning and delegate to mode controller
        
    def handle_mouse_release(self, event, widget_point):
        # Handle panning end and delegate to mode controller
        
    def handle_key_press(self, event):
        # Delegate to mode controller
        
    def handle_wheel(self, event, widget_point):
        # Handle zooming
```

### ModeController

The ModeController is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all mode controllers. Mode-specific controllers inherit from this class and implement the required methods.

```python
class ModeController(ABC):
    def __init__(self, view_state, selection_model, hover_state, graph):
        # Initialize models
        
    @abstractmethod
    def handle_mouse_press(self, event, graph_point, widget_point):
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def handle_mouse_move(self, event, graph_point, widget_point):
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def handle_mouse_release(self, event, graph_point, widget_point):
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def handle_key_press(self, event):
        pass
```

### Integration Plan

To integrate the new input handling system with CanvasView:

1. Add InputHandler as a member of CanvasView
2. Update CanvasView's event handlers to delegate to InputHandler
3. Remove direct state manipulation from CanvasView
4. Update CanvasView to focus on rendering and delegating input

```python
def mousePressEvent(self, event):
    self.input_handler.handle_mouse_press(event, event.pos())
    self.update()

def mouseMoveEvent(self, event):
    self.input_handler.handle_mouse_move(event, event.pos())
    self.update()

def mouseReleaseEvent(self, event):
    self.input_handler.handle_mouse_release(event, event.pos())
    self.update()

def keyPressEvent(self, event):
    self.input_handler.handle_key_press(event)
    self.update()

def wheelEvent(self, event):
    self.input_handler.handle_wheel(event, event.pos())
    self.update()
```

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Improved Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between models, views, and controllers
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Each class has a single responsibility
3. **Improved Testability**: Easier to write unit tests for each component
4. **Better Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify the codebase
5. **Extensibility**: Easier to add new features or modify existing ones

## Conclusion

The refactoring is making good progress, with the model layer complete and the rendering system mostly implemented. The event handling system has been designed and implemented, but needs to be integrated with the CanvasView class. The next steps are to complete the integration and test the new system.
